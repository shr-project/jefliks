Jefliks

This project is a try to write real tiny and fast XMPP/Jabber client
for handheld devices, supported by Enlightment Foundation Library.
I use Elementary widget toolkit and Iksemel library to make it possible.

Makefile

make [all]    - builds application;
make ipk      - builds package for opkg;
make install  - install application;
make clean    - cleans all temporary and builded files.

I don't think that autotools must be necessary here, fix me if it's not that.
